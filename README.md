# MPM repository
Repository of Minecraft plugins, for usage with MPM command line utility.

## Notes
Due to a lot of spam, and abandoned projects, scraped data about the plugins from spigotmc.org / bukkit.org will not be automatically added to the repository file (/repository/data.json), if a plugin is below 50,000 downloads. If you want to see such plugin in the repository, you can add it manually; for instructions see [Contributing](#contributing) section.

## Contributing
If you want to add/change a plugin in the repository, you can do it in two ways:

  1. Submit an issue, providing the plugin's name,] description, and link to the plugin's page on spigotmc.org / bukkit.org or plugin's repository on github.com / other git hosting service.
  2. Add the plugin to the repository file (/repository/data.json), and submit a pull request.
